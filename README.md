# Quit-Smoking-Tracker
Simple program that calculates how many days it has been since your initial quitting date, how much money you save each day, and how much cigarettes you haven't smoked. I will add more features to the program later down the line.
For now it only runs in the terminal.

It needs 4 arguments to run:

date - priceperpack - cigarettesperpack - cigarettessmokedperday


Date format: month-day-year - examples: april -27-2021 / 04-27-2021 / 4-27-21


Example:


$ node index.js 04-27-2021 7.50 19 15
